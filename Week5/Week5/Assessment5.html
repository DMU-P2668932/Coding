    <h1>To whoever is reading this, hi.</h1>
    <p>My name's Lachlan, and I've not touched a piece of code since Year 9, and even then I sucked at it.
      But hopefully this year I'll be able to, <strong>maybe</strong>, make something good</p>
      <h2 style= "background-color: orange">Coding Background</h2>
      <p>All I remember about doing coding in high school was doing a bit of small basic, and back
       it just looked like a heck of a load of gibberish. But here I am now, going back at it again, but this time I'm also
      paying Â£9k a year to do it</p>
        <!--Except from scratch, but does that really count as coding?-->
      <h2  style= "background-color: red">But enough about my awkward background with coding, here's a list of
      games I've been playing a lot recently (please don't make me code something close to one of these)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Call of Duty: Cold War</li>
        <li>The Binding Of Isaac</li>
        <li>Marvel's Avengers (Thanks to Xbox for giving it to me for free)</li>
        <li>World War Z</li>
      </ol>

      <p>A picture of a cute dog (unfortunately not mine), you can click it to
      take you to a funny youtube video</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Some audio I kinda liked that I can't get sued for using</h2>
      <audio controls loop>
      <source src="Audio\8bit.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      <source src="Audio\8bit.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
      <source src="Audio\8bit.wav" type="audio/wav">
      </audio>
      <h2>And a quick video aswell, because why not?</h2>
      <video controls autoplay width=100% poster="Image\Dogs.jpg">
      <source src="Video\lines.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
<p>If you can't see the audio or video, the browser you're on doesn't like you
and won't accept the file type, or the file is too big for github to have it :(</p>
