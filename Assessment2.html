    <h1>To whoever is reading this, hi.</h1>
    <p>My name's Lachlan, and I've not touched a piece of code since Year 9, and even then I sucked at it.
      But hopefully this year I'll be able to, <strong>maybe</strong>, make something good</p>
      <h2 style= "background-color: orange">Coding Background</h2>
      <p>All I remember about doing coding in high school was doing a <strong>tiny<strong> bit of small basic, and back
       it just looked like a heck of a load of gibberish. But here I am now, going back at it again, but this time I'm also
      paying Â£9k a year to do it</p>
        <!--Except from scratch, but does that really count as coding?-->
      <h2  style= "background-color: red">But enough about my awkward background with coding, here's a list of
      games I've been playing a lot recently (please don't make me code something close to one of these)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Call of Duty: Cold War</li>
        <li>The Binding Of Isaac</li>
        <li>Marvel's Avengers (Thanks to Xbox for giving it to me for free)</li>
        <li>World War Z</li>
      </ol>
