<h1>Dogs working at a bank?!</h1>
<h2>Three reasons why dogs are good banktellers</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>They really like people</li>
    <li>They can focus well</li>
    <li>They are surprisingly smart</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Businesses suited to animal employees</h2>
    <p>Many businesses could benefit from our feathered and furry friends in the
    workplace.</p>
    <h3>Cafes</h3>
    <p style="color: green; background-color: black">Perhaps you've been to a cat cafe already? Relax with a coffee and be
    soothed by the elegant slow dance and soft purring of some feline friends.</p>
<h3>Hospitals</h3>
<p style="color: blue; background-color: orange">Hospitals often have a need to move small things like sample tubes and paperwork
 to other parts of the hospital quickly, often along long narrow corridors.
 Parrots would be perfectly suited to this role, and would also help brighten
 things up, adding a little cheer for those enjoying a temporary stay.</p>
 <h3>Window cleaning</h3>
 <p style="color: red; background-color: lightblue">If window cleaners used Pelicans to hold their water, instead of carrying a
 bucket up a ladder, it's estimated that 356 window cleaning injuries a year
 could be avoided. They're also good company on a lunch break.</p>
