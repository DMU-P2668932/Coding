    <h1>To whoever is reading this, hi.</h1>
    <p>My name's Lachlan, and I've not touched a piece of code since Year 9, and even then I sucked at it.
      But hopefully this year I'll be able to, <strong>maybe</strong>, make something good</p>
      <h2 style= "background-color: orange">Coding Background</h2>
      <p>All I remember about doing coding in high school was doing a bit of small basic, and back
       it just looked like a heck of a load of gibberish. But here I am now, going back at it again, but this time I'm also
      paying £9k a year to do it</p>
        <!--Except from scratch, but does that really count as coding?-->
      <h2  style= "background-color: red">But enough about my awkward background with coding, here's a list of
      games I've been playing a lot recently (please don't make me code something close to one of these)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Call of Duty: Cold War</li>
        <li>The Binding Of Isaac</li>
        <li>Marvel's Avengers (Thanks to Xbox for giving it to me for free)</li>
        <li>World War Z</li>
      </ol>

      take you to a funny youtube video</p>

      <h2>Some audio from a game I like</h2>
      <audio controls loop>
      <source src="Audio\Kirby.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      <source src="Audio\Kirby.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
      <source src="Audio\Kirby.wav" type="audio/wav">
      </audio>
      <h2>And a quick video aswell, because why not?</h2>
      <video controls autoplay width=40% poster="Image\Dogs.jpg">
      <source src="Video\nyancat.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <source src="Video\nyancat.webm" type="video/webm">
      </video>
<p>If you can't see the audio or video, the browser you're on doesn't like you
and won't accept the file type :(</p>
